= myfind

Prints a bunch of file names to the console, separated by newlines.

== Options

`-t [fld]`:: Filter by types of files. Currently supports `f` for regular
files, `l` for links, and `d` for directories. These can be combined in an
arbitrary order like `fld` (which is the same as specifying nothing).
